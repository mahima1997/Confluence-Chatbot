Compared to FY’23 (with 1Bn+ Incremental sales), there is a considerable \ndecrease in impact owing to a combination of factors outlined below.\nDrop in Attributed Sales : Compared to FY’23, there is a 30% decrease in overall sales attributed to Roundel campaigns.

This can be \nattributed to a decrease in campaigns opted for Optimization in Q4 due to multiple planned AB tests ( ). With the implementation of DRAO in viz\nplace this year, there has also been a decrease in frequency of Optimus interventions which impacted the coverage negatively.\nIncrease in baseline sales (from Manual Optimization): Optimus sales lift % has decreased from 18.6% in FY’23 to 12.5% in FY’24 as an \noutcome of increase in baseline improvement from Manual Optimization.
