The Trader will still have to open inventory because it is also\nimpossible to optimize it manually with the same budget and impressions constraints. But if the required inventory\nis opened, then Trader can accept the recommendation.</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>No Suggestion</td><td>Empty file</td><td>In these cases, trading partners receive an empty file when downloading optimizations available.

So at this moment\nOptimus recommendation will not be as much as fruitful as it could have been until the updated MP\nThis generally occurs when the recommendations are received prior to changes being implemented in CMP.\nFor example, there's an outstanding change (or adjustment) to the Media Plan which the Trading team is aware of –\nbut has not been implemented yet – so Optimus is sending recommendations pre-change.</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>Version has\ndifferent\nobjective</td><td>Version has different\nobjective</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>16\n[\nN\ne\nw]</td><td>Error in 2 or\nless versions\nwhere\ncampaigns\ncontains 5 or\nmore versions</td><td>Entire recommendation was\nrejected due to error in 2 or\nless versions where\ncampaigns contains 5 or\nmore versions</td><td>Use this reason strictly only when you are rejecting recommendation for a campaign having 5 or more versions, and\nthe error is present in 2 or fewer versions.</td></tr><tr><td>D\ne\np\nr\ne\nc\nat\ned</td><td>Other</td><td>Exceptional scenarios not\nincluded in reject reasons list</td><td>Need to be reported to Product Team.
